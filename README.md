IMPLEMENTATION OF VISION SYSTEM IN ROBOTIC ARM (UR5) FOR NON-STANDARD PACKAGE PALLETIZING


my main goal  was to implement a vision system for the robotic arm so that it could be
executed as an autonomous robotic palletizer to solve multiple shape palletizing problem which
usually requires human interference. This goal can be achieved by undergoing successive stages of
implementation of the following.
1. Implementation of vison system to determine the object shape, size, angle and location of the
object.
2. Solving 2D bin packing problem to find the optimal packing solution
3. Data communication between Raspberry pi and UR5
4. Executing the transferred command on to the UR5 to pick and place object to desired location.
